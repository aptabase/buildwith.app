      <p>
        Electron is a popular open-source framework that allows developers to
        build desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. Electron was initially developed by GitHub and is based on
        Node.js and Chromium, which enables developers to create cross-platform
        desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux using a single
        codebase.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the benefits of Electron is that it provides a familiar
        development environment for web developers, who can use their existing
        skills to create desktop applications. Electron also provides access to
        many web technologies and libraries, which can be leveraged to create
        rich and interactive desktop user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Electron provides a range of tools and APIs that make it easy for
        developers to build powerful desktop applications, including system
        integrations, native dialog boxes, and file system access. However,
        performance may become an issue for some applications due to
        single-threaded Node.js and the use of a webview to render the
        interface.
